The Log package is one of the standard library packages of the<a target="_blank" href="https://ballerina.io/"> Ballerina</a> language.

This package provides a basic API for logging.

### Loggers 

Each module in Ballerina has its own dedicated logger. A log record contains the timestamp, log level, module name, and the log message. The `printError()` function takes an optional `error` record apart from the log message. A sample log record logged from the `foo` module would look as follows:
```bash
time = 2020-12-16 11:22:44,029 level = ERROR module = myorg/foo message = "Something went wrong."
```

### Log Output

Logs are written to the `stderr` stream (i.e., the console) by default in order to make the logs more container friendly.

To publish the logs to a file, redirect the `stderr` stream to a file.
```bash
$ ballerina run program.bal 2> b7a-user.log
```
